# Python Crash Course Week

SRD is hosting a live beginner Python course over Zoom for the first time this spring. The course will consist of 2 hours of theory per day + 1 hour of practice and personal exercices/projects for 5 days. It will run from 9am to noon, Monday June 1st to Friday June 5th.

The course aims to lay the foundation for understanding modern high level programming languages and the ecosystem around them necessary for daily use. The more specific Python skills we will cover include data cleaning and analysis, data visualization, web APIs, and bots.

Rather than try to dive too deep into any specific Python skill, the course will attempt cover the fundamentals and generate broad understanding of how to integrate Python into one's work. We will provide attendees with a solid working knowledge of 4 fundamental pieces of software: **Git**, **GitHub**, **Bash** (command line terminal) and **Python**. Following the course, attendees will understand the infrastructure needed to integrate Python into their projects, the types of jobs it is best suited for, and how to interact with and leverage  other people's work/projects into their own.

<br />

## Register
The course is free, as it is given by an SRD analyst. If you are interested in registering for this course, please confirm with your manager and send an email to <a href="mailto:patrick.bussiere@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca">patrick.bussiere@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca</a>. As this is the first edition, we will be testing out with a small group to ensure all attendees get the most of the course.

## 3 themes over 5 days

### Python
1. Python fundamentals: data types, data structures, functions, loops
2. Python intermediate concepts: object-oriented programming, libraries, imports, scripting
3. Projects: using APIs to fetch data, write bots to automate tasks

<br />

### Git and GitHub
Git is a fundamental piece of software development, and is easy to learn. Attendees will develop a working knowledge of version control sytems and understand why they are so important in a daily workflow.

<br />

### Bash
Bash is the heart of good software development. Examples and exercices will prompt attendees to think more precicely about communications between them and their computers, and why the command line is such a useful tool for development.
