# Day 4 Exercises

1. Get a Jupyter notebook running, and run two of your previous exercises in it.

2. Find an interesting notebook on [A gallery of interesting Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-Jupyter-Notebooks#social-data) and try to run it fully on your machine. See the error messages you get and start trying to understand them (hint: the most important part of the error message is often at the very end).

3. Find a dataset you'd like to explore. Kaggle is a great place to start.
