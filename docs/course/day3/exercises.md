# Day 3 Exercises

<br />

1. Create a module with functions for (1) finding the highest number in a list, (2) finding the lowest number in a list, (3) finding the average of the numbers in a list, (4) subtracting an adjustable number to each item in a list without going into negative numbers (0 being the lowest the numbers can go), and (5) combining 2 lists of numbers into 1. In a different file, import that module and test your functions on the following lists:

```python
[13, 67, 57,  43,  26,  19,   9,  33,  59,  90,  20,  64,   6,  81,  51,  92,  17,   1,  29,  98,  49,  58,  87,  39,  74,  61,  70,  40,  80,  36,  48,  38,  77,  46,  50,  34,  53,  42,  84,  52,   4,  72,  73,  79,  65,   8,  93,  69,  54,  28,  16,  31,  11,  44,  41,  75,  56,   5,  78,  23,  62,  99,  32, 100,  85,  24,  35,  10,  76,  95,  60,  63]

[27, 787, 801, 956, 613, 355, 859, 496, 775, 963, 973, 928, 891,   1, 818, 717, 484, 966, 288, 587, 180, 737, 334, 601, 328, 939, 242, 551, 121, 560, 368, 240, 711, 694, 130, 453, 739, 102,   8, 825, 354, 715, 832, 908, 262,  77,  73, 151]
```

2. Create a command line utility that writes entries given by a user into a journal file. Entries should be dated as well as appended. Your journal app should also offer the option to print to console the latest "x" number of entries, as per the user's choice.

3. Start a server for the 2-page website in `all-code/website`.

4. Create a magic 8-ball application that takes a question from the user and answers from a random list of predetermined answers.

5. Write a class called `Rectangle` that can create rectangles objects. Theses objects will need dimensions, colours, and names. You should include methods to calculate the area of the rectangle, as well as changing their names and colours.
